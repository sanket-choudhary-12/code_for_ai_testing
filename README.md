# Big Code Test (100K-Line Python File)

This repository contains a synthetic **100,000-line Python script** designed for testing:

- AI model long-context capabilities  
- Code understanding and parsing  
- Performance benchmarks  
- Tokenization and embedding behavior  
- Stress-testing editors and code tools  

The file `big_code_100k_working.py` is fully runnable and ends with a **checksum output** to verify correct execution.
